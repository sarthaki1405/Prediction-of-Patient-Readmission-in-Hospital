# Prediction of Patient Readmission in Hospital  

## Project Overview  
This project predicts patient readmission within 30 days of discharge using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The goal is to enhance hospital management and patient care by identifying high-risk patients early.  

## Motivation  
- High readmission rates indicate poor patient care and increased healthcare costs.  
- Predicting readmission can improve healthcare quality by enabling early intervention.  
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning offer promising solutions for predictive analysis.  

## Dataset  
- **Source:** *Diabetes 130-US dataset (1999-2008)*  
- **Size:** 101,766 patient records  
- **Features:** 50 attributes, including patient demographics, medical history, lab results, and medications.  

## Challenges Addressed  
- **Missing Data:** Implemented multiple imputation techniques (MICE, KNN, Mean/Mode).  
- **Class Imbalance:** Used oversampling (SMOTE) and undersampling.  
- **Feature Selection:** Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Boruta method.  
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluated multiple ML and DL models.
